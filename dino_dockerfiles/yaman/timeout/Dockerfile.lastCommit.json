This means the container does not exit after\nreceiving the SIGTERM but docker will invoke, usually after 10 seconds,\na SIGKILL. This is somewhat unclean.","tree":{"sha":"52722fe72ff09bc9e79083383295ffa70c03bbbe","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yaman/timeout/git/trees/52722fe72ff09bc9e79083383295ffa70c03bbbe"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yaman/timeout/git/commits/7d4d81db35452ea221e398c133a1a4c158879b6a","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yaman/timeout/commits/7d4d81db35452ea221e398c133a1a4c158879b6a","html_url":"https://github.com/yaman/timeout/commit/7d4d81db35452ea221e398c133a1a4c158879b6a","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yaman/timeout/commits/7d4d81db35452ea221e398c133a1a4c158879b6a/comments","author":{"login":"mjeri","id":4903245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MDMyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4903245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjeri","html_url":"https://github.com/mjeri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjeri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjeri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjeri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjeri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjeri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjeri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjeri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjeri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjeri/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"mjeri","id":4903245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MDMyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4903245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjeri","html_url":"https://github.com/mjeri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjeri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjeri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjeri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjeri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjeri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjeri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjeri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjeri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjeri/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"57ae1aeeb6fa2598e029e1a797e5ca41c236d757","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yaman/timeout/commits/57ae1aeeb6fa2598e029e1a797e5ca41c236d757","html_url":"https://github.com/yaman/timeout/commit/57ae1aeeb6fa2598e029e1a797e5ca41c236d757"}]}]
