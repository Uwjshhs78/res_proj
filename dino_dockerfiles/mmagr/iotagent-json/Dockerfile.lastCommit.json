It doesn't require any extra configuration\n(such as creating devices) - for each new message that it receives,\nit asks (or, at least, will ask) DeviceManager if that device exists\nand which is its ID (and related fiware-service, for now). After\nreceiving a valid answer (the device indeed exists), it sends\nan update message to Orion, just like before (almost - it now uses\nthe simpler Orion's v2 API)","tree":{"sha":"c72feb677a2485de7e771f353689937ec91ca6f5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mmagr/iotagent-json/git/trees/c72feb677a2485de7e771f353689937ec91ca6f5"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mmagr/iotagent-json/git/commits/b88879e2df6aa07ca67f2cee9b4f8a906a69d596","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mmagr/iotagent-json/commits/b88879e2df6aa07ca67f2cee9b4f8a906a69d596","html_url":"https://github.com/mmagr/iotagent-json/commit/b88879e2df6aa07ca67f2cee9b4f8a906a69d596","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mmagr/iotagent-json/commits/b88879e2df6aa07ca67f2cee9b4f8a906a69d596/comments","author":{"login":"giovannicuriel","id":6285982,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyODU5ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6285982?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/giovannicuriel","html_url":"https://github.com/giovannicuriel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giovannicuriel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giovannicuriel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giovannicuriel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giovannicuriel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giovannicuriel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giovannicuriel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giovannicuriel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giovannicuriel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giovannicuriel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"giovannicuriel","id":6285982,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyODU5ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6285982?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/giovannicuriel","html_url":"https://github.com/giovannicuriel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giovannicuriel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giovannicuriel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giovannicuriel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giovannicuriel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giovannicuriel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giovannicuriel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giovannicuriel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giovannicuriel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giovannicuriel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"96cef6df91935c09bcf9b1b7794228a65a8c204b","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mmagr/iotagent-json/commits/96cef6df91935c09bcf9b1b7794228a65a8c204b","html_url":"https://github.com/mmagr/iotagent-json/commit/96cef6df91935c09bcf9b1b7794228a65a8c204b"}]}]
