It just calls the send\nmessage endpoint with the right parameters, as documented\nhere: https://pushover.net/api\n\nTo render the message we use `eval` which is prone to\nshell injections. But not a big deal: Whoever is running this\nresource is able to run any container and any command in the\nrunners anyway.[1]\n\nThe curl returns a json, and it is IMPORTANT that we capture it.\nOtherwise smuggler will ignore the versions file. We capture\nit and put it in the metadata.\n\nhttps://github.com/redfactorlabs/concourse-smuggler-resource/issues/19","tree":{"sha":"eb2686137012934e40680a26173067c56dc8e49b","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redfactorlabs/concourse-pushover-resource/git/trees/eb2686137012934e40680a26173067c56dc8e49b"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redfactorlabs/concourse-pushover-resource/git/commits/6134126ac4f2f01424ff6767c74e4cf8c8b44396","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redfactorlabs/concourse-pushover-resource/commits/6134126ac4f2f01424ff6767c74e4cf8c8b44396","html_url":"https://github.com/redfactorlabs/concourse-pushover-resource/commit/6134126ac4f2f01424ff6767c74e4cf8c8b44396","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redfactorlabs/concourse-pushover-resource/commits/6134126ac4f2f01424ff6767c74e4cf8c8b44396/comments","author":{"login":"keymon","id":280032,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDAzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280032?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keymon","html_url":"https://github.com/keymon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keymon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keymon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keymon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keymon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keymon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keymon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keymon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keymon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keymon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"keymon","id":280032,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDAzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280032?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keymon","html_url":"https://github.com/keymon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keymon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keymon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keymon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keymon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keymon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keymon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keymon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keymon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keymon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"e11522f427ee0be50e67e87ffc413f0f98ca20b8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redfactorlabs/concourse-pushover-resource/commits/e11522f427ee0be50e67e87ffc413f0f98ca20b8","html_url":"https://github.com/redfactorlabs/concourse-pushover-resource/commit/e11522f427ee0be50e67e87ffc413f0f98ca20b8"}]}]
