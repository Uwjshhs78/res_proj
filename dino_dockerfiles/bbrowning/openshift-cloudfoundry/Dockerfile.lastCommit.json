The old CentOS-based Dockerfile was renamed to\nDockerfile.centos and will be kept around for now\n\nThis commit also includes work done to populate the VCAP_SERVICES\nenvironment variable for database services so that the rails-sample\nCloud Foundry application deploys properly.","tree":{"sha":"21b972c72ca9c73ff12edfaee7ebdc36b5421c24","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bbrowning/openshift-cloudfoundry/git/trees/21b972c72ca9c73ff12edfaee7ebdc36b5421c24"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bbrowning/openshift-cloudfoundry/git/commits/7f1098f048dd4ca15957a402d3651e3562dbc133","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bbrowning/openshift-cloudfoundry/commits/7f1098f048dd4ca15957a402d3651e3562dbc133","html_url":"https://github.com/bbrowning/openshift-cloudfoundry/commit/7f1098f048dd4ca15957a402d3651e3562dbc133","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bbrowning/openshift-cloudfoundry/commits/7f1098f048dd4ca15957a402d3651e3562dbc133/comments","author":{"login":"bbrowning","id":56071,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MDcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56071?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrowning","html_url":"https://github.com/bbrowning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrowning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrowning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrowning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrowning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrowning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrowning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrowning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrowning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrowning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"bbrowning","id":56071,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MDcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56071?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrowning","html_url":"https://github.com/bbrowning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrowning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrowning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrowning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrowning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrowning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrowning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrowning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrowning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbrowning/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"2e65d275babbd62e1a0d59a23d2fbc66da98d1ac","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bbrowning/openshift-cloudfoundry/commits/2e65d275babbd62e1a0d59a23d2fbc66da98d1ac","html_url":"https://github.com/bbrowning/openshift-cloudfoundry/commit/2e65d275babbd62e1a0d59a23d2fbc66da98d1ac"}]}]
