I have updated your docker file, to make it cleaner and build to a smaller image size. The modified docker file builds to an image of size 537 MB, while the original docker file resulted in an image of size 640 MB. I have built and tested the modified docker file, and works awesome. Please accept my proposal for docker file change.","tree":{"sha":"600423cbd1ff20c5a64eb905e96387f53dc424f1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lionellow/nginx-rtmp-dockerfile-pal/git/trees/600423cbd1ff20c5a64eb905e96387f53dc424f1"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lionellow/nginx-rtmp-dockerfile-pal/git/commits/13662fb2d1378032d744e2542ae73abdd926f6d0","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lionellow/nginx-rtmp-dockerfile-pal/commits/13662fb2d1378032d744e2542ae73abdd926f6d0","html_url":"https://github.com/lionellow/nginx-rtmp-dockerfile-pal/commit/13662fb2d1378032d744e2542ae73abdd926f6d0","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lionellow/nginx-rtmp-dockerfile-pal/commits/13662fb2d1378032d744e2542ae73abdd926f6d0/comments","author":{"login":"Mizzlr","id":8148804,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNDg4MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8148804?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mizzlr","html_url":"https://github.com/Mizzlr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mizzlr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mizzlr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mizzlr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mizzlr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mizzlr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mizzlr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mizzlr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mizzlr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mizzlr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"web-flow","id":19864447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODY0NDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19864447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow","html_url":"https://github.com/web-flow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/web-flow/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"17f27360fe1674a0b648f3491df9b25d7ac9215d","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lionellow/nginx-rtmp-dockerfile-pal/commits/17f27360fe1674a0b648f3491df9b25d7ac9215d","html_url":"https://github.com/lionellow/nginx-rtmp-dockerfile-pal/commit/17f27360fe1674a0b648f3491df9b25d7ac9215d"}]}]
