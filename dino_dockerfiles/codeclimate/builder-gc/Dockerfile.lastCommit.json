I had an image in a\nreliable state where it would come and never execute anything until you\nran `crontab -e` or `-l` to \"touch\" the cron system in some way.\nInvestigating changing how we loaded the crontab was triggered by a\ncustomer issue with unreliable builder-gc. In my testing the alpine\nimage has worked exactly as expected and not flaky at all, and it also\ncuts down the image size by a couple hundred MB, so I think this is\nworthile, although it does mean we need to lean on less-readable flags\nfor `xargs` and `tail`.","tree":{"sha":"3e73daaad3a5fbc0a5d154dd84e5e9892a6d841b","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/codeclimate/builder-gc/git/trees/3e73daaad3a5fbc0a5d154dd84e5e9892a6d841b"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/codeclimate/builder-gc/git/commits/0da76577faa235b1d9ab2de4eab42f1e4a136e59","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/codeclimate/builder-gc/commits/0da76577faa235b1d9ab2de4eab42f1e4a136e59","html_url":"https://github.com/codeclimate/builder-gc/commit/0da76577faa235b1d9ab2de4eab42f1e4a136e59","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/codeclimate/builder-gc/commits/0da76577faa235b1d9ab2de4eab42f1e4a136e59/comments","author":{"login":"wfleming","id":188402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4ODQwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/188402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wfleming","html_url":"https://github.com/wfleming","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wfleming/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wfleming/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wfleming/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wfleming/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wfleming/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wfleming/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wfleming/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wfleming/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wfleming/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"wfleming","id":188402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4ODQwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/188402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wfleming","html_url":"https://github.com/wfleming","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wfleming/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wfleming/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wfleming/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wfleming/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wfleming/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wfleming/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wfleming/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wfleming/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wfleming/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"459948021ca9eb1b59fc777c24997aa61a41fd26","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/codeclimate/builder-gc/commits/459948021ca9eb1b59fc777c24997aa61a41fd26","html_url":"https://github.com/codeclimate/builder-gc/commit/459948021ca9eb1b59fc777c24997aa61a41fd26"}]}]
