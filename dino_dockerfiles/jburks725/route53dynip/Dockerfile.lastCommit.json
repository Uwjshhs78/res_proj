It also removes the `build.sh` script and replaces it with a\nsimple `Makefile`.\n\nThe `Makefile` has a target to build a local image for development\nas well as a target for a multi-arch build with `buildx` that pushes\nto DockerHub.","tree":{"sha":"0dea5cb05a8840d6ed2ba44eccfec9bfdac6cfd2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jburks725/route53dynip/git/trees/0dea5cb05a8840d6ed2ba44eccfec9bfdac6cfd2"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jburks725/route53dynip/git/commits/04ea8c0fdb7fe17bd130c11182131bdcad46f84a","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jburks725/route53dynip/commits/04ea8c0fdb7fe17bd130c11182131bdcad46f84a","html_url":"https://github.com/jburks725/route53dynip/commit/04ea8c0fdb7fe17bd130c11182131bdcad46f84a","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jburks725/route53dynip/commits/04ea8c0fdb7fe17bd130c11182131bdcad46f84a/comments","author":{"login":"jburks725","id":1072024,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzIwMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1072024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburks725","html_url":"https://github.com/jburks725","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburks725/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburks725/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburks725/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburks725/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburks725/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburks725/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburks725/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburks725/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburks725/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"jburks725","id":1072024,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzIwMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1072024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburks725","html_url":"https://github.com/jburks725","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburks725/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburks725/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburks725/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburks725/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburks725/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburks725/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburks725/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburks725/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jburks725/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"3c825fcf45efeca2c1a7f68f6341dbb14f51aa52","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jburks725/route53dynip/commits/3c825fcf45efeca2c1a7f68f6341dbb14f51aa52","html_url":"https://github.com/jburks725/route53dynip/commit/3c825fcf45efeca2c1a7f68f6341dbb14f51aa52"}]}]
