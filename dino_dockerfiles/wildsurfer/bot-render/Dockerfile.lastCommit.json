Moves to Chrome Stable (since headless is now in 59).\r\n2. Reduces the layer count in the docker file build.\r\n3. Fixes lint errors in Dockerfile\r\n4. Adds a non-privileged user called `botrender` to container (so you don't have to use `--unsafe-perm` with the npm install)\r\n5. Expose 8080 for port binding and add documentation to allow running against service without `docker exec`\r\n6. Document seccomp and SYS_ADMIN flags to reduce ECONNREFUSED confusion and use of `--disable-sandbox` as noted in #3","tree":{"sha":"882bad64430d6306a582a43baf969a272425d652","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wildsurfer/bot-render/git/trees/882bad64430d6306a582a43baf969a272425d652"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wildsurfer/bot-render/git/commits/6cb63938502c738253f8160a0471d215b7b9210a","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wildsurfer/bot-render/commits/6cb63938502c738253f8160a0471d215b7b9210a","html_url":"https://github.com/wildsurfer/bot-render/commit/6cb63938502c738253f8160a0471d215b7b9210a","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wildsurfer/bot-render/commits/6cb63938502c738253f8160a0471d215b7b9210a/comments","author":{"login":"justinribeiro","id":643503,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MzUwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/643503?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinribeiro","html_url":"https://github.com/justinribeiro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinribeiro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinribeiro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinribeiro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinribeiro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinribeiro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinribeiro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinribeiro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinribeiro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinribeiro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"samuelli","id":787668,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NzY2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/787668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelli","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelli/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"5d658e64ec1f5d29534a6ff601716b96337a39f6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wildsurfer/bot-render/commits/5d658e64ec1f5d29534a6ff601716b96337a39f6","html_url":"https://github.com/wildsurfer/bot-render/commit/5d658e64ec1f5d29534a6ff601716b96337a39f6"}]}]
