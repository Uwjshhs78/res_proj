The Firefox\nupgrade may fix the problem.\n\nWhy custom SlimerJS? Because at the time of writing, SlimerJS doesn't\nwork with Firefox v60.\n\nI had anticipated the problem might be in some of SlimerJS's code, but\nafter hacking away at it I think it's extremely efficient: I doubt I\ndeleted any code that was even being called.\n\nShould segfaults persist, I think the next step is to rip out the\nSlimerJS _loader_ and hard-code convert.js into an application.ini. This\nwould take a bit more learning than I'm ready to do today. It might give\nan actual speedup, though.","tree":{"sha":"c17bc3cec7b8da806d12d8973c33da9bf369dbf2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/overview/overview-convert-html/git/trees/c17bc3cec7b8da806d12d8973c33da9bf369dbf2"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/overview/overview-convert-html/git/commits/e14f605677f73fbb7eb79cda1ea4dc5db048b51d","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/overview/overview-convert-html/commits/e14f605677f73fbb7eb79cda1ea4dc5db048b51d","html_url":"https://github.com/overview/overview-convert-html/commit/e14f605677f73fbb7eb79cda1ea4dc5db048b51d","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/overview/overview-convert-html/commits/e14f605677f73fbb7eb79cda1ea4dc5db048b51d/comments","author":{"login":"adamhooper","id":10812,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10812?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamhooper","html_url":"https://github.com/adamhooper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamhooper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamhooper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamhooper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamhooper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamhooper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamhooper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamhooper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamhooper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamhooper/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"adamhooper","id":10812,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10812?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamhooper","html_url":"https://github.com/adamhooper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamhooper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamhooper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamhooper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamhooper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamhooper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamhooper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamhooper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamhooper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamhooper/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"1a1727e21225d99095656053b79599414c2d8050","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/overview/overview-convert-html/commits/1a1727e21225d99095656053b79599414c2d8050","html_url":"https://github.com/overview/overview-convert-html/commit/1a1727e21225d99095656053b79599414c2d8050"}]}]
