This was a bit clunky\nso now we include the foundation steps (building an updated version of\nOpenSSL and renaming some of the libraries) in stock OpenMRSLab, as this\ndoes not break anything else, and adding a hypothetical \"orchestra\"\nfolder inside the Jupyter work directory to the PythonPath. Thus all the\nuser needs to do now is create that folder, either through a mapped\nfolder or uploading via Jupyter itself, and copy the SDK into it.\n\nWe have also taken the opportunity to update the Jupyter base container\nwhich is now running on Ubuntu 20.04, and Python 3.8. GCC has been\ndowngraded from the default of 9 back to 8 as there are some issues\ncompiling NiftyReg with version 9 (which relate to OpenMP in some way).\n\nWe also upgrade to Suspect v0.4.3.","tree":{"sha":"d226cc2b4ce9b87e1bf4c981df401eb0efe21555","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openmrslab/openmrslab/git/trees/d226cc2b4ce9b87e1bf4c981df401eb0efe21555"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openmrslab/openmrslab/git/commits/575d3e0437cc0dd97df74aa32ac3389e33f661de","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openmrslab/openmrslab/commits/575d3e0437cc0dd97df74aa32ac3389e33f661de","html_url":"https://github.com/openmrslab/openmrslab/commit/575d3e0437cc0dd97df74aa32ac3389e33f661de","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openmrslab/openmrslab/commits/575d3e0437cc0dd97df74aa32ac3389e33f661de/comments","author":{"login":"bennyrowland","id":5189118,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODkxMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5189118?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bennyrowland","html_url":"https://github.com/bennyrowland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bennyrowland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bennyrowland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bennyrowland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bennyrowland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bennyrowland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bennyrowland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bennyrowland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bennyrowland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bennyrowland/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"bennyrowland","id":5189118,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODkxMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5189118?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bennyrowland","html_url":"https://github.com/bennyrowland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bennyrowland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bennyrowland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bennyrowland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bennyrowland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bennyrowland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bennyrowland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bennyrowland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bennyrowland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bennyrowland/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"5f4000c70fd21d064740f4d4c61dcdeb4f8eb973","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openmrslab/openmrslab/commits/5f4000c70fd21d064740f4d4c61dcdeb4f8eb973","html_url":"https://github.com/openmrslab/openmrslab/commit/5f4000c70fd21d064740f4d4c61dcdeb4f8eb973"}]}]
