On a traditional\nsystem this makes sense: it uses the unix user model to separate\nbower packages from the system. By not being root, the scripts can't\nreally attack the system. In Docker, the separation is provided by the\ncontainer system, so running foreign scripts as root isn't as much of\nan issue. By being in a container, foreign scripts can't attack the\nsystem.\n\nAllowing root disables the user-based separation model.","tree":{"sha":"4ad1692bca8828a08d6253473b8941b67c071043","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/suutari/shoop/git/trees/4ad1692bca8828a08d6253473b8941b67c071043"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/suutari/shoop/git/commits/40933f28e00cbc42551b392610bc3d27d1270520","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/suutari/shoop/commits/40933f28e00cbc42551b392610bc3d27d1270520","html_url":"https://github.com/suutari/shoop/commit/40933f28e00cbc42551b392610bc3d27d1270520","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/suutari/shoop/commits/40933f28e00cbc42551b392610bc3d27d1270520/comments","author":{"login":"kvdveer","id":419433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxOTQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/419433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvdveer","html_url":"https://github.com/kvdveer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvdveer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvdveer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvdveer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvdveer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvdveer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvdveer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvdveer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvdveer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvdveer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"kvdveer","id":419433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxOTQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/419433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvdveer","html_url":"https://github.com/kvdveer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvdveer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvdveer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvdveer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvdveer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvdveer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvdveer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvdveer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvdveer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kvdveer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"6fa2c55625cbf566d5e11eeaf7654ca1832b538c","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/suutari/shoop/commits/6fa2c55625cbf566d5e11eeaf7654ca1832b538c","html_url":"https://github.com/suutari/shoop/commit/6fa2c55625cbf566d5e11eeaf7654ca1832b538c"}]}]
