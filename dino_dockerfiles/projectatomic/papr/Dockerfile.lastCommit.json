We teach our\nprovisioner to do this in this patch. This is required to support\nprojects like atomic and container-storage-setup which want a secondary\ndisk for testing.\n\nI didn't bother cleaning up the code much. A lot of this is already\nstructured much more nicely in the Python rewrite and I didn't want to\nduplicate more work than necessary.","tree":{"sha":"168c06ac59fb27b4f32cf499f643db15210566e4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/projectatomic/papr/git/trees/168c06ac59fb27b4f32cf499f643db15210566e4"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/projectatomic/papr/git/commits/82c995b1e6efe0a58cf66a05202dec7006027f3e","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/projectatomic/papr/commits/82c995b1e6efe0a58cf66a05202dec7006027f3e","html_url":"https://github.com/projectatomic/papr/commit/82c995b1e6efe0a58cf66a05202dec7006027f3e","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/projectatomic/papr/commits/82c995b1e6efe0a58cf66a05202dec7006027f3e/comments","author":{"login":"jlebon","id":11934099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTM0MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11934099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlebon","html_url":"https://github.com/jlebon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlebon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlebon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlebon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlebon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlebon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlebon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlebon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlebon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlebon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"jlebon","id":11934099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTM0MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11934099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlebon","html_url":"https://github.com/jlebon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlebon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlebon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlebon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlebon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlebon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlebon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlebon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlebon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlebon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"ede122d6e3190f70c49cd46c4a5e9fe8909493df","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/projectatomic/papr/commits/ede122d6e3190f70c49cd46c4a5e9fe8909493df","html_url":"https://github.com/projectatomic/papr/commit/ede122d6e3190f70c49cd46c4a5e9fe8909493df"}]}]
