this may change in the future\n* docker-compose.yml updated to use `docker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana:6.2.3` for its Kibana\n* docker-compose.config.yml is updated to docker-compose format 3.5, and `CONFIG_DIR` is removed (at least temporarily - need to rethink external config)\n* logstash.conf now points at elasticsearch as there is no `-master` node, template now points at a different location for jetty-request-template.json\n\nAdd a default logstash.yml:\n* Sets the `http.host` to `0.0.0.0`\n* Sets `config.support_escapes` to `true` so that folks can use escape sequences in their Grok pattern configuration\n* Gets copied into `/usr/share/logstash/config/logstash.yml`\n\nFirst stab at rebuilding dashboards/visualization:\n* Update logstash.yml to enable X-Pack based monitoring\n* `load.sh` will now wait for Kibana to spin up, courtesy of a snippet from https://github.com/elastic/stack-docker/blob/master/scripts/setup-beat.sh\n* Remove old `docker-entrypoint.sh`: we now call `load.sh` and then delegate to the original entrypoint\n    * Although it's not recommended to re-run the logstash-in-a-box image, it should be possible\n* Move logstash conf into a dedicated subdirectory, so that it's less confusing to people reading the source\n\nSwap import to a Python script that can parse a Kibana saved object export:\n* Runs under Python 2.7.5, which is what's on the logstash image\n* Move from hand-curated JSON files to a set of Kibana-exported objects","tree":{"sha":"482124cbf4d91b0c1ee8ec2e7322435d78f554d7","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/8x8Cloud/logstash-in-a-box/git/trees/482124cbf4d91b0c1ee8ec2e7322435d78f554d7"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/8x8Cloud/logstash-in-a-box/git/commits/5d911c53dc3c0b5358a785c066b7a9326db6c69a","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/8x8Cloud/logstash-in-a-box/commits/5d911c53dc3c0b5358a785c066b7a9326db6c69a","html_url":"https://github.com/8x8Cloud/logstash-in-a-box/commit/5d911c53dc3c0b5358a785c066b7a9326db6c69a","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/8x8Cloud/logstash-in-a-box/commits/5d911c53dc3c0b5358a785c066b7a9326db6c69a/comments","author":{"login":"kog","id":855593,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NTU5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/855593?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kog","html_url":"https://github.com/kog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kog/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"kog","id":855593,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NTU5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/855593?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kog","html_url":"https://github.com/kog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kog/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"d75e324373e2bdc41041dfb603eb91e8e4158b8b","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/8x8Cloud/logstash-in-a-box/commits/d75e324373e2bdc41041dfb603eb91e8e4158b8b","html_url":"https://github.com/8x8Cloud/logstash-in-a-box/commit/d75e324373e2bdc41041dfb603eb91e8e4158b8b"}]}]
