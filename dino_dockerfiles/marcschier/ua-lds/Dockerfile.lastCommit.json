Removed VS 2013 sln. Update\n      readme.md and use latest ansi-c stack from master.\n    * Windows build uses dnssd.dll from dnssd repo rather than checked in Apple\n      code.\n    * Update to only poll in 2 places (todo: 1 poll loop with multiple fd) and\n      synchronized access to sdref between poll thread (main) and server threads\n      to fix race conditions and crashes. Removed obsolete reentrant locking.\n    * Add platform support for Linux using Avahi dnssd adapter library.\n    * Add dockerfile to create base image with lds-me support (for .net stack).\n    * Simplfied debugging and trouble shooting:\n    \t* Default to -d when _DEBUG defined\n    \t* Precreate file paths for pki if they do not exist. Fallback to use cwd\n      \t  if configured file path for pki does not exist and cannot be created.\n    \t* Set tracing in config files for stack to \"error\", not off.\n    * Make lds static registration permanent without knowing the semfile by\n      allowing to specify * as semfile. If semfile does not exist lds entry is\n      immediately removed.","tree":{"sha":"19543334c572326cb302fe00db6a36007920ff9e","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/marcschier/UA-LDS/git/trees/19543334c572326cb302fe00db6a36007920ff9e"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/marcschier/UA-LDS/git/commits/3c42663e20ae14e79e53ad4a9c1008ff45d29304","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/marcschier/UA-LDS/commits/3c42663e20ae14e79e53ad4a9c1008ff45d29304","html_url":"https://github.com/marcschier/UA-LDS/commit/3c42663e20ae14e79e53ad4a9c1008ff45d29304","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/marcschier/UA-LDS/commits/3c42663e20ae14e79e53ad4a9c1008ff45d29304/comments","author":{"login":"marcschier","id":11168470,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTY4NDcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11168470?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcschier","html_url":"https://github.com/marcschier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcschier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcschier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcschier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcschier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcschier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcschier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcschier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcschier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcschier/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"marcschier","id":11168470,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTY4NDcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11168470?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcschier","html_url":"https://github.com/marcschier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcschier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcschier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcschier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcschier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcschier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcschier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcschier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcschier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcschier/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"ce3d0e7358d20ff0537a08c074d6bdf92c888df4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/marcschier/UA-LDS/commits/ce3d0e7358d20ff0537a08c074d6bdf92c888df4","html_url":"https://github.com/marcschier/UA-LDS/commit/ce3d0e7358d20ff0537a08c074d6bdf92c888df4"}]}]
