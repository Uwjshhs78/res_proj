The major thing is that the extractor assumes the user already authorized the links in GUI and the helpers extracted the configuration for that. The extractor just reads the CSV files and process them via streams without any modification, which saves a lot of memory consumption. The extractor also prepares particular manifest files.","tree":{"sha":"f8621a1faf1c257d72f762ff2f8e145535bc3bde","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/radektomasek/keboola-ex-dropbox-v2/git/trees/f8621a1faf1c257d72f762ff2f8e145535bc3bde"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/radektomasek/keboola-ex-dropbox-v2/git/commits/b41c9ab34c5149b9ad00ea2550afb132b261cfe1","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/radektomasek/keboola-ex-dropbox-v2/commits/b41c9ab34c5149b9ad00ea2550afb132b261cfe1","html_url":"https://github.com/radektomasek/keboola-ex-dropbox-v2/commit/b41c9ab34c5149b9ad00ea2550afb132b261cfe1","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/radektomasek/keboola-ex-dropbox-v2/commits/b41c9ab34c5149b9ad00ea2550afb132b261cfe1/comments","author":{"login":"radektomasek","id":958534,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1ODUzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/958534?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/radektomasek","html_url":"https://github.com/radektomasek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radektomasek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radektomasek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radektomasek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radektomasek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radektomasek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radektomasek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radektomasek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radektomasek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radektomasek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"radektomasek","id":958534,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1ODUzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/958534?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/radektomasek","html_url":"https://github.com/radektomasek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radektomasek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radektomasek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radektomasek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radektomasek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radektomasek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radektomasek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radektomasek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radektomasek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radektomasek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"44283ba214b9d521516f4c9129d7bd42580d8b24","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/radektomasek/keboola-ex-dropbox-v2/commits/44283ba214b9d521516f4c9129d7bd42580d8b24","html_url":"https://github.com/radektomasek/keboola-ex-dropbox-v2/commit/44283ba214b9d521516f4c9129d7bd42580d8b24"}]}]
