Also, log messages are easier to read and parse with tools like\n`grep` thanks to being more consistent all across code, and to including some\nextra context in key places.\n\nEnhancements:\n\n- Add `router.bt.ouinet.work:6881` and `routerx.bt.ouinet.work:5060` as\n  BitTorrent DHT bootstrap nodes.  As with other name-based bootstrap nodes\n  used by Ouinet, they can be hot-patched via `/etc/hosts`,\n  personalDNSfilter (Android) or similar.\n- Allow specifying port of bootstrap node in BitTorrent DHT code.\n- Store BitTorrent DHT contacts periodically to avoid losing them on crash.\n- Make log messages more consistent.  The generic format is:\n  `Prefix: Message[: object][(...|status)][;( key=value)+]`.\n- Add (shortened) target in request/response log messages to avoid having to\n  lookup the target based on the request number.\n\nBugfixes:\n\n- Fix minor cancellation oversights in BitTorrent DHT contacts store.","tree":{"sha":"5e6836e30ba9aa5d5419f6799cee34317ea8720d","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/equalitie/ouinet/git/trees/5e6836e30ba9aa5d5419f6799cee34317ea8720d"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/equalitie/ouinet/git/commits/72321d9882377fc5866f9dfe4da8dfe3222fbe89","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/equalitie/ouinet/commits/72321d9882377fc5866f9dfe4da8dfe3222fbe89","html_url":"https://github.com/equalitie/ouinet/commit/72321d9882377fc5866f9dfe4da8dfe3222fbe89","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/equalitie/ouinet/commits/72321d9882377fc5866f9dfe4da8dfe3222fbe89/comments","author":{"login":"ivilata","id":420791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/420791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivilata","html_url":"https://github.com/ivilata","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivilata/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivilata/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivilata/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivilata/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivilata/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivilata/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivilata/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivilata/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivilata/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"ivilata","id":420791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDc5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/420791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivilata","html_url":"https://github.com/ivilata","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivilata/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivilata/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivilata/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivilata/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivilata/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivilata/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivilata/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivilata/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivilata/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"7cc46c66c24db52b3fe0eae4d830a4ded07ef3c6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/equalitie/ouinet/commits/7cc46c66c24db52b3fe0eae4d830a4ded07ef3c6","html_url":"https://github.com/equalitie/ouinet/commit/7cc46c66c24db52b3fe0eae4d830a4ded07ef3c6"}]}]
