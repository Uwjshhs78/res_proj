So when it\ncomes to things like NPM installs, package installations from APT, or\nany other file-generative operations, it is a good idea to clean up\nafter yourself within the same RUN directive.\n\nThis overhaul of the Dockerfile does just that, and trims us down to a\nsingle RUN command that cleans up after itself as best as I'm aware we                  can. We're even deleting `node_modules`. Which is fun.\n\nI don't know that we can trim it much more without creating our own\nsquashed fc-base image. For now though this should help.","tree":{"sha":"85acccfec6998c1242d25a65ded8210aa243411b","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fantasycalendar/Fantasy-Calendar/git/trees/85acccfec6998c1242d25a65ded8210aa243411b"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fantasycalendar/Fantasy-Calendar/git/commits/464979ce89fcf60719dfec4dae7a8e00cc605ec7","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fantasycalendar/Fantasy-Calendar/commits/464979ce89fcf60719dfec4dae7a8e00cc605ec7","html_url":"https://github.com/fantasycalendar/Fantasy-Calendar/commit/464979ce89fcf60719dfec4dae7a8e00cc605ec7","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fantasycalendar/Fantasy-Calendar/commits/464979ce89fcf60719dfec4dae7a8e00cc605ec7/comments","author":{"login":"V13Axel","id":2779682,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzk2ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2779682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/V13Axel","html_url":"https://github.com/V13Axel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/V13Axel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/V13Axel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/V13Axel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/V13Axel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/V13Axel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/V13Axel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/V13Axel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/V13Axel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/V13Axel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"V13Axel","id":2779682,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzk2ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2779682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/V13Axel","html_url":"https://github.com/V13Axel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/V13Axel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/V13Axel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/V13Axel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/V13Axel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/V13Axel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/V13Axel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/V13Axel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/V13Axel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/V13Axel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"5db0b6b96d78aaa1e80d25c86eaf8844ce6173ff","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fantasycalendar/Fantasy-Calendar/commits/5db0b6b96d78aaa1e80d25c86eaf8844ce6173ff","html_url":"https://github.com/fantasycalendar/Fantasy-Calendar/commit/5db0b6b96d78aaa1e80d25c86eaf8844ce6173ff"}]}]
