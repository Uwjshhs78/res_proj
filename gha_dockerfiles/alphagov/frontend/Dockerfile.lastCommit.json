We'll need assets\nto be uploaded to a static serving service as a deployment step,\notherwise rolling updates won't be possible (because each pod would only\nhave the assets from its own version, not the next/previous version).\n\nAlternatives considered: We tried using the Bitnami ruby images (which\nhave an attractive support/update policy) but ran into difficulties with\nbundler and versions/locations of gems.\n\nCo-authored-by: Chris Banks <chris.banks@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk>","tree":{"sha":"59d9b19ff3804e8bac8386e788e4d8273af28da9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alphagov/frontend/git/trees/59d9b19ff3804e8bac8386e788e4d8273af28da9"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alphagov/frontend/git/commits/de3750e29e2957dcc56c441c33870acae56e33a8","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alphagov/frontend/commits/de3750e29e2957dcc56c441c33870acae56e33a8","html_url":"https://github.com/alphagov/frontend/commit/de3750e29e2957dcc56c441c33870acae56e33a8","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alphagov/frontend/commits/de3750e29e2957dcc56c441c33870acae56e33a8/comments","author":{"login":"karlbaker02","id":5422487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MjI0ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5422487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02","html_url":"https://github.com/karlbaker02","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"karlbaker02","id":5422487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MjI0ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5422487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02","html_url":"https://github.com/karlbaker02","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"bbe234db8c437eeb3a43e2feda7bd61d7539753e","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alphagov/frontend/commits/bbe234db8c437eeb3a43e2feda7bd61d7539753e","html_url":"https://github.com/alphagov/frontend/commit/bbe234db8c437eeb3a43e2feda7bd61d7539753e"}]}]
