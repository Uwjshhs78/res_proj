Adding `base_image` allows for our `build-images` pipeline to specify `govuk-ruby-X.Y.Z` when packaging for production, pulling this base image from a private ECR repository; for local development, the base image will remain unchanged from the default as the `base_image` arg will not be overridden.","tree":{"sha":"c48853bc938aff6607404327e4e082095c32409f","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alphagov/publishing-api/git/trees/c48853bc938aff6607404327e4e082095c32409f"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alphagov/publishing-api/git/commits/aa755c2b649244613abd3df81085b0bd3e157c1f","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alphagov/publishing-api/commits/aa755c2b649244613abd3df81085b0bd3e157c1f","html_url":"https://github.com/alphagov/publishing-api/commit/aa755c2b649244613abd3df81085b0bd3e157c1f","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alphagov/publishing-api/commits/aa755c2b649244613abd3df81085b0bd3e157c1f/comments","author":{"login":"karlbaker02","id":5422487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MjI0ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5422487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02","html_url":"https://github.com/karlbaker02","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"karlbaker02","id":5422487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MjI0ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5422487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02","html_url":"https://github.com/karlbaker02","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karlbaker02/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"fdd2875d7f88ac633bbf63ef59501ab8d5edb632","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alphagov/publishing-api/commits/fdd2875d7f88ac633bbf63ef59501ab8d5edb632","html_url":"https://github.com/alphagov/publishing-api/commit/fdd2875d7f88ac633bbf63ef59501ab8d5edb632"}]}]
