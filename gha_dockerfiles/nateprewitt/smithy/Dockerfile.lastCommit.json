Each supported build target is built by\ndownloading the appropriate JDK from Corretto and running jlink.\n\nThe Dockerfile has been updated to now use the prebuilt binary for\nlinux-x86_64, and will now use application class data sharing to improve\nCLI startup time in the Docker container.\n\nA couple dependencies were updated, including Gradle, in order to build\non JDK 16. JDK 16 also complained about creating an explicitly boxed\nvalue, so that was addressed too.\n\nFuture work should include building signed tar.gz and zip files, creating a\nMac pkg file via jpackage, and creating an msi via jpackage.","tree":{"sha":"a9bfd52dcd626ce93d7a44a648f7162573622a7b","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nateprewitt/smithy/git/trees/a9bfd52dcd626ce93d7a44a648f7162573622a7b"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nateprewitt/smithy/git/commits/8548dc7ab16025b3c74770eed245ce3e9e7a372f","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nateprewitt/smithy/commits/8548dc7ab16025b3c74770eed245ce3e9e7a372f","html_url":"https://github.com/nateprewitt/smithy/commit/8548dc7ab16025b3c74770eed245ce3e9e7a372f","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nateprewitt/smithy/commits/8548dc7ab16025b3c74770eed245ce3e9e7a372f/comments","author":{"login":"mtdowling","id":190930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDkzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/190930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling","html_url":"https://github.com/mtdowling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"mtdowling","id":190930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDkzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/190930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling","html_url":"https://github.com/mtdowling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdowling/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"0a3b32589c18fe24220b22a6b7e41ea0912b15ca","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nateprewitt/smithy/commits/0a3b32589c18fe24220b22a6b7e41ea0912b15ca","html_url":"https://github.com/nateprewitt/smithy/commit/0a3b32589c18fe24220b22a6b7e41ea0912b15ca"}]}]
