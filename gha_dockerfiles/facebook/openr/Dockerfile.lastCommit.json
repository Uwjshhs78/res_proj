Building and installing Facebook libraries with fbcode_builder\n2. Building Open/R\n3. Generating Cython files from thrift files with the FB thrift compiler\n4. Generating C++ files from the Cython modules with the Cython compiler\n5. Compiling the C++ modules into shared objects\n\nFuture work for building and distributing Breeze:\n\n- Fix the hacks in build_breeze.sh, see comments therein\n- Use a staged Dockerfile build for the Open/R and Breeze build\n- Install openr.thrift. The openr.thrift shared objects are build and\n  stored in the Docker image generated by Dockerfile, but are unused.\n- Install all the openr python submodules in a single openr site-package\n- Add cross-compilation to the openr.thrift build. This is needed for\n  Terragraph\n- Upload the openr python package to PyPi\n\nReviewed By: saifhhasan\n\nDifferential Revision: D28614443\n\nfbshipit-source-id: 38b7e7c5594fd4bb5a338f19c69e5fc3b3b95863","tree":{"sha":"10d5b10927b71a412b8d5e56cbdb3ecdb86a28e0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/openr/git/trees/10d5b10927b71a412b8d5e56cbdb3ecdb86a28e0"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/openr/git/commits/d62b9aa1a203963cb6ceabb2396d1dbfd1660478","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/openr/commits/d62b9aa1a203963cb6ceabb2396d1dbfd1660478","html_url":"https://github.com/facebook/openr/commit/d62b9aa1a203963cb6ceabb2396d1dbfd1660478","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/openr/commits/d62b9aa1a203963cb6ceabb2396d1dbfd1660478/comments","author":{"login":"MatthewWEdwards","id":19556631,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTU2NjMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19556631?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewWEdwards","html_url":"https://github.com/MatthewWEdwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewWEdwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewWEdwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewWEdwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewWEdwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewWEdwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewWEdwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewWEdwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewWEdwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatthewWEdwards/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"facebook-github-bot","id":6422482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjI0ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6422482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/facebook-github-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/facebook-github-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/facebook-github-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/facebook-github-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/facebook-github-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/facebook-github-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/facebook-github-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/facebook-github-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/facebook-github-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/facebook-github-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/facebook-github-bot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"8531d05197f69cc02b6a4ebbdd2f4178bbd40841","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/openr/commits/8531d05197f69cc02b6a4ebbdd2f4178bbd40841","html_url":"https://github.com/facebook/openr/commit/8531d05197f69cc02b6a4ebbdd2f4178bbd40841"}]}]
