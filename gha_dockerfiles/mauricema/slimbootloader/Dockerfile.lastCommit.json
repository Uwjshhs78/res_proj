The majority previously used DOS-style CRLF line endings. Add a\n.gitattributes file to enforce this and treat certain extensions as\nnever being text files.\n\nUpdate PatchCheck.py to insist on LF line endings rather than CRLF.\nHowever, its other checks fail on this commit due to lots of\npre-existing complaints that it only notices because the line endings\nhave changed.\n\nSilicon/QemuSocPkg/FspBin/Patches/0001-Build-QEMU-FSP-2.0-binaries.patch\nneeds to be treated as binary since it contains a mixture of line\nendings.\n\nThis change has implications depending on the client platform you are\nusing the repository from:\n\n* Windows\n\nThe usual configuration for Git on Windows means that text files will\nbe checked out to the work tree with DOS-style CRLF line endings. If\nthat's not the case then you can configure Git to do so for the entire\nmachine with:\n\n git config --global core.autocrlf true\n\nor for just the repository with:\n\n git config core.autocrlf true\n\nLine endings will be normalised to LF when they are committed to the\nrepository. If you commit a text file with only LF line endings then it\nwill be converted to CRLF line endings in your work tree.\n\n* Linux, MacOS and other Unices\n\nThe usual configuration for Git on such platforms is to check files out\nof the repository with LF line endings. This is probably the right thing\nfor you. In the unlikely even that you are using Git on Unix but editing\nor compiling on Windows for some reason then you may need to tweak your\nconfiguration to force the use of CRLF line endings as described above.\n\n* General\n\nFor more information see\nhttps://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/configuring-git-to-handle-line-endings .\n\nFixes: https://github.com/slimbootloader/slimbootloader/issues/1400\nSigned-off-by: Mike Crowe <mac@mcrowe.com>","tree":{"sha":"780e08dcd5ff5db0a0e14f11e3eaf886e567d467","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mauricema/slimbootloader/git/trees/780e08dcd5ff5db0a0e14f11e3eaf886e567d467"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mauricema/slimbootloader/git/commits/990e3e81e6bd1642670f7a1d118237ab7b5f24b6","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mauricema/slimbootloader/commits/990e3e81e6bd1642670f7a1d118237ab7b5f24b6","html_url":"https://github.com/mauricema/slimbootloader/commit/990e3e81e6bd1642670f7a1d118237ab7b5f24b6","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mauricema/slimbootloader/commits/990e3e81e6bd1642670f7a1d118237ab7b5f24b6/comments","author":{"login":"mikecrowe","id":93615,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93615?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikecrowe","html_url":"https://github.com/mikecrowe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikecrowe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikecrowe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikecrowe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikecrowe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikecrowe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikecrowe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikecrowe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikecrowe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikecrowe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"mauricema","id":11727697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzI3Njk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11727697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mauricema","html_url":"https://github.com/mauricema","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mauricema/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mauricema/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mauricema/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mauricema/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mauricema/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mauricema/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mauricema/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mauricema/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mauricema/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"8c75111faa82a4d3dc241c54a34f42dd2e57bc45","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mauricema/slimbootloader/commits/8c75111faa82a4d3dc241c54a34f42dd2e57bc45","html_url":"https://github.com/mauricema/slimbootloader/commit/8c75111faa82a4d3dc241c54a34f42dd2e57bc45"}]}]
