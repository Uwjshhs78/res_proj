This causes the builds to fail. Fix this by vendoring\nthe key in the swift repo directly. This should be more reliable.\n\nUpstream bug at https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay/issues/352\n\nNote I looked up the pubkey given the hash on that issue and copied its\ncontents into this change. I can't vouch for the validity of this key\nbeyond that. However, if it is listed in that issue and validates the\npackages from s6 then it is probably good.\n\nChange-Id: I3f42fbaae5f246836024f95b549b487b41bd6f1d","tree":{"sha":"3edd4797b266c340a8f8f70eeaed2e389859b208","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openstack/swift/git/trees/3edd4797b266c340a8f8f70eeaed2e389859b208"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openstack/swift/git/commits/930ac1114b9d2c91c2d6c277202a80b729ff9903","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openstack/swift/commits/930ac1114b9d2c91c2d6c277202a80b729ff9903","html_url":"https://github.com/openstack/swift/commit/930ac1114b9d2c91c2d6c277202a80b729ff9903","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openstack/swift/commits/930ac1114b9d2c91c2d6c277202a80b729ff9903/comments","author":{"login":"cboylan","id":231403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTQwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/231403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cboylan","html_url":"https://github.com/cboylan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cboylan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cboylan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cboylan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cboylan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cboylan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cboylan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cboylan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cboylan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cboylan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"cboylan","id":231403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTQwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/231403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cboylan","html_url":"https://github.com/cboylan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cboylan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cboylan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cboylan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cboylan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cboylan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cboylan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cboylan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cboylan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cboylan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"f190ba2b7d02693ee2d7b59043b0baf9fddd203b","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openstack/swift/commits/f190ba2b7d02693ee2d7b59043b0baf9fddd203b","html_url":"https://github.com/openstack/swift/commit/f190ba2b7d02693ee2d7b59043b0baf9fddd203b"}]}]
