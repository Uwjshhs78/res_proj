It was meant as a way to cache\ndependencies for faster CI and dev time, but it causes too many issues.\nFor example, a two-iteration lag to get new packages in, confusion when\nbuilding the image re. what you'll actually get, and duplication of\nsteps between the two Dockerfiles.\n\nLet's go back to what we had before #2290 and we can discuss other ways\nto optimize CI and the dev flow.","tree":{"sha":"9c3c93c114ab182abb0c7bb7842103c7fca7a0ce","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coreos/coreos-assembler/git/trees/9c3c93c114ab182abb0c7bb7842103c7fca7a0ce"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coreos/coreos-assembler/git/commits/e772b1ab3097c54b089c2e22100c2e18fc4e1eb8","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coreos/coreos-assembler/commits/e772b1ab3097c54b089c2e22100c2e18fc4e1eb8","html_url":"https://github.com/coreos/coreos-assembler/commit/e772b1ab3097c54b089c2e22100c2e18fc4e1eb8","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coreos/coreos-assembler/commits/e772b1ab3097c54b089c2e22100c2e18fc4e1eb8/comments","author":{"login":"jlebon","id":11934099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTM0MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11934099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlebon","html_url":"https://github.com/jlebon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlebon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlebon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlebon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlebon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlebon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlebon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlebon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlebon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlebon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"cgwalters","id":244096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NDA5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/244096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgwalters","html_url":"https://github.com/cgwalters","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgwalters/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgwalters/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgwalters/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgwalters/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgwalters/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgwalters/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgwalters/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgwalters/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgwalters/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"30c2813639104e44f9f63a59702a5b9b9b291122","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/coreos/coreos-assembler/commits/30c2813639104e44f9f63a59702a5b9b9b291122","html_url":"https://github.com/coreos/coreos-assembler/commit/30c2813639104e44f9f63a59702a5b9b9b291122"}]}]
