Move to registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/openjdk-11 for all\n   container images.\n2. Update build.gradle pass `--release 8` to javac, to keep\n   compiling against Java 8.\n3. Update checkstyle config to be jdk11 compatible, by using\n   `config_loc` variable.\n4. Update podman command to use the user's UID properly (attempted to do\n   this before, but got it wrong).\n5. Update podman command w/ `--rm` to cleanup after itself.\n6. Update podman command to put the gradle cache in the Jenkins\n   workspace.\n7. Change hacky counting in TaskManager, that for some reason failed\n   tests w/ JDK11.\n\nThere is still work to do to fully move to Java 11, but this will\nget us on an updated JDK in the short-term.","tree":{"sha":"cdcaf358daf85079c48c9a0625fe383748717150","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RedHatInsights/rhsm-subscriptions/git/trees/cdcaf358daf85079c48c9a0625fe383748717150"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RedHatInsights/rhsm-subscriptions/git/commits/075b5e6c7309fd6fd28de83b3586021994c3d3c0","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RedHatInsights/rhsm-subscriptions/commits/075b5e6c7309fd6fd28de83b3586021994c3d3c0","html_url":"https://github.com/RedHatInsights/rhsm-subscriptions/commit/075b5e6c7309fd6fd28de83b3586021994c3d3c0","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RedHatInsights/rhsm-subscriptions/commits/075b5e6c7309fd6fd28de83b3586021994c3d3c0/comments","author":{"login":"kahowell","id":1716882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTY4ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1716882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kahowell","html_url":"https://github.com/kahowell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kahowell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kahowell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kahowell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kahowell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kahowell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kahowell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kahowell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kahowell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kahowell/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"kahowell","id":1716882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTY4ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1716882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kahowell","html_url":"https://github.com/kahowell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kahowell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kahowell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kahowell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kahowell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kahowell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kahowell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kahowell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kahowell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kahowell/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"bae37c9159dd2e525e234dfd0dcc680fc7f6f1dd","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RedHatInsights/rhsm-subscriptions/commits/bae37c9159dd2e525e234dfd0dcc680fc7f6f1dd","html_url":"https://github.com/RedHatInsights/rhsm-subscriptions/commit/bae37c9159dd2e525e234dfd0dcc680fc7f6f1dd"}]}]
