But this approach might not work with older/newer versions of ubuntu since they might come with a different/incompatible version of llvm. It also wouldn't work should CLIF require a newer version of LLVM at some point.\n\nAlso found/fixed a bug in github action workflows that resulted in the build always running on ubuntu 18.04 despite marking the version as 20.04 in the job name.\n\nTested: https://github.com/google/clif/actions/runs/1330929253, https://github.com/google/clif/actions/runs/1330929236\nPiperOrigin-RevId: 402429753","tree":{"sha":"919b3194910aacb97919ce7704bbe0b5b311773e","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/clif/git/trees/919b3194910aacb97919ce7704bbe0b5b311773e"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/clif/git/commits/83c7941aae9f01a575adc719b1baed3c6607b8f4","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/clif/commits/83c7941aae9f01a575adc719b1baed3c6607b8f4","html_url":"https://github.com/google/clif/commit/83c7941aae9f01a575adc719b1baed3c6607b8f4","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/clif/commits/83c7941aae9f01a575adc719b1baed3c6607b8f4/comments","author":{"login":"akekawit","id":63809965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzODA5OTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63809965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akekawit","html_url":"https://github.com/akekawit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akekawit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akekawit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akekawit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akekawit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akekawit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akekawit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akekawit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akekawit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akekawit/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"rwgk","id":740480,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDQ4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/740480?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwgk","html_url":"https://github.com/rwgk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwgk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwgk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwgk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwgk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwgk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwgk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwgk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwgk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwgk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"1a3e63daa2649edcadab56b4f101605746c4e4e8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/clif/commits/1a3e63daa2649edcadab56b4f101605746c4e4e8","html_url":"https://github.com/google/clif/commit/1a3e63daa2649edcadab56b4f101605746c4e4e8"}]}]
