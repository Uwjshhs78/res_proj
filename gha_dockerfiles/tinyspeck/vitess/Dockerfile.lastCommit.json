This broke the automated build on Docker Hub because now it assumes \"/docker/base\" as build context and not \"/\" anymore. But \"/\" as build context is required to run \"make build\" and access the source code.\n\nTherefore, I'm re-adding \"Dockerfile\" as symlink pointing to \"docker/base/Dockerfile\".\n\nI'm also deleting \"docker/base/README.md\" again because I only added it for the automated build (it must be in the same directory as the \"Dockerfile\"). With the switch back to \"/\" as build context, it will use \"/README.md\" instead.","tree":{"sha":"286fef05845350652cb07b522a6d52e7e052404e","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tinyspeck/vitess/git/trees/286fef05845350652cb07b522a6d52e7e052404e"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tinyspeck/vitess/git/commits/b3c3604c3bf530a364206dd4591f2291c29a2630","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tinyspeck/vitess/commits/b3c3604c3bf530a364206dd4591f2291c29a2630","html_url":"https://github.com/tinyspeck/vitess/commit/b3c3604c3bf530a364206dd4591f2291c29a2630","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tinyspeck/vitess/commits/b3c3604c3bf530a364206dd4591f2291c29a2630/comments","author":{"login":"michael-berlin","id":3919251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MTkyNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3919251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-berlin","html_url":"https://github.com/michael-berlin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-berlin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-berlin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-berlin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-berlin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-berlin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-berlin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-berlin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-berlin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-berlin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"michael-berlin","id":3919251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MTkyNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3919251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-berlin","html_url":"https://github.com/michael-berlin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-berlin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-berlin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-berlin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-berlin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-berlin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-berlin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-berlin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-berlin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-berlin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"00c7c2dda0ec485d0c91907397278304c9dd9048","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tinyspeck/vitess/commits/00c7c2dda0ec485d0c91907397278304c9dd9048","html_url":"https://github.com/tinyspeck/vitess/commit/00c7c2dda0ec485d0c91907397278304c9dd9048"}]}]
