I could\nnot diagnose why that is, but assume it has to deal with the\nproxying done by ingress.  Disabling shouldn't create any security\nissues.\n\nAlpine Linux has dropped pip3.  You now have to install py3-pip.\n\nFix URL from javascript side.  This may not be needed and would\ncause issues if a non-standard port was used.\n\nHaving some issues where output seems to be buffered.","tree":{"sha":"67f0550c9f2f874acb97c49d633dc84d6a3ab149","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/krkeegan/insteon-mqtt/git/trees/67f0550c9f2f874acb97c49d633dc84d6a3ab149"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/krkeegan/insteon-mqtt/git/commits/f6de54a627d36066f0be0c8fe4a3834f7aabf985","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/krkeegan/insteon-mqtt/commits/f6de54a627d36066f0be0c8fe4a3834f7aabf985","html_url":"https://github.com/krkeegan/insteon-mqtt/commit/f6de54a627d36066f0be0c8fe4a3834f7aabf985","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/krkeegan/insteon-mqtt/commits/f6de54a627d36066f0be0c8fe4a3834f7aabf985/comments","author":{"login":"krkeegan","id":3046315,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDYzMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3046315?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/krkeegan","html_url":"https://github.com/krkeegan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krkeegan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krkeegan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krkeegan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krkeegan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krkeegan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krkeegan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krkeegan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krkeegan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krkeegan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"krkeegan","id":3046315,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDYzMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3046315?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/krkeegan","html_url":"https://github.com/krkeegan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krkeegan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krkeegan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krkeegan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krkeegan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krkeegan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krkeegan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krkeegan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krkeegan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krkeegan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"a17b25b1a4f13a2b9a5eb76f5c32cc9807830a0c","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/krkeegan/insteon-mqtt/commits/a17b25b1a4f13a2b9a5eb76f5c32cc9807830a0c","html_url":"https://github.com/krkeegan/insteon-mqtt/commit/a17b25b1a4f13a2b9a5eb76f5c32cc9807830a0c"}]}]
