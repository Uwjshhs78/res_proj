What we want is if NPROC is not set, use\n$(nproc) otherwise use NPROC passed via command line. You can't do this,\neven with setting ENV, because it can't evaluate commands at runtime.\n\nExporting commands via RUN, only persist for that RUN command as each\nRUN sets up a containerized ENV, so you'd have to run an if/else check\nfor each RUN. There are other hacky work-arounds like writing $(nproc)\nto a file and reading it if NPROC isn't passed but all of this is more\ntrouble than its worth.\n\nWhen we have an issue with needing to restrict the -j param on make, we\ncan use one of the workarounds.\n\n- Change openssl to just vanilla make and make install_sw, currently as\nis doesn't work in the container, reports make error.","tree":{"sha":"a7ec6127ede347339c291f46b2873d6e4b2baf99","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/darcys22/loki-core/git/trees/a7ec6127ede347339c291f46b2873d6e4b2baf99"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/darcys22/loki-core/git/commits/120f37ebdf585477f8c0ea5841366cd7619c5d43","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/darcys22/loki-core/commits/120f37ebdf585477f8c0ea5841366cd7619c5d43","html_url":"https://github.com/darcys22/loki-core/commit/120f37ebdf585477f8c0ea5841366cd7619c5d43","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/darcys22/loki-core/commits/120f37ebdf585477f8c0ea5841366cd7619c5d43/comments","author":{"login":"Doy-lee","id":12163539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTYzNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12163539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Doy-lee","html_url":"https://github.com/Doy-lee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Doy-lee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Doy-lee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Doy-lee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Doy-lee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Doy-lee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Doy-lee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Doy-lee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Doy-lee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Doy-lee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"Doy-lee","id":12163539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTYzNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12163539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Doy-lee","html_url":"https://github.com/Doy-lee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Doy-lee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Doy-lee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Doy-lee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Doy-lee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Doy-lee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Doy-lee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Doy-lee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Doy-lee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Doy-lee/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"933c16b92dfa4e99fde8478add853a3f1afcfbaa","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/darcys22/loki-core/commits/933c16b92dfa4e99fde8478add853a3f1afcfbaa","html_url":"https://github.com/darcys22/loki-core/commit/933c16b92dfa4e99fde8478add853a3f1afcfbaa"}]}]
