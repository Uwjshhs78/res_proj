With this change we:\n\n- install nut on the final image as part of the docker build\n- copy over nut.conf and ups.conf which configure NUT for a single local (via USB) UPS using the standard usbhid-ups driver\n- have a NutUpsDevice class that can initialize and shutdown the NUT services and poll the UPS status (online/onbattery/lowbattery or unknown for 'probably disconnected') and battery charge (int 0-100 or -1 for 'probably disconnected')\n\nThis doesn't actually do anything with the data right now - it's not getting pushed anywhere or reported. But I've tested on an APC Smart UPS 500 Li and it's getting the right data back.\n\nSee sample-site.json for an example UPS device definition.","tree":{"sha":"942db0cea528221ddee15063b081f1ae3fcecaf7","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/terraware/terraware-devices/git/trees/942db0cea528221ddee15063b081f1ae3fcecaf7"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/terraware/terraware-devices/git/commits/1ea76098343d03c60d130dcdbe6fd69ebef02259","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/terraware/terraware-devices/commits/1ea76098343d03c60d130dcdbe6fd69ebef02259","html_url":"https://github.com/terraware/terraware-devices/commit/1ea76098343d03c60d130dcdbe6fd69ebef02259","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/terraware/terraware-devices/commits/1ea76098343d03c60d130dcdbe6fd69ebef02259/comments","author":{"login":"mrpathos","id":66536205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NTM2MjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66536205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrpathos","html_url":"https://github.com/mrpathos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrpathos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrpathos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrpathos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrpathos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrpathos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrpathos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrpathos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrpathos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrpathos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"mrpathos","id":66536205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NTM2MjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66536205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrpathos","html_url":"https://github.com/mrpathos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrpathos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrpathos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrpathos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrpathos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrpathos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrpathos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrpathos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrpathos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrpathos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"16d9fb0d186e271c9527df3fd25ed036cbb85d04","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/terraware/terraware-devices/commits/16d9fb0d186e271c9527df3fd25ed036cbb85d04","html_url":"https://github.com/terraware/terraware-devices/commit/16d9fb0d186e271c9527df3fd25ed036cbb85d04"}]}]
