An user can override this (e.g. by `-e` option in `docker run`) to run docker container in regtest or testnet or any valid argument to `--network`.","tree":{"sha":"a871b39b16c353180169b73ae0886b567e2e5384","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baby636/lightning/git/trees/a871b39b16c353180169b73ae0886b567e2e5384"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baby636/lightning/git/commits/0b1f8fdbf0633e557946c90ae7a094126075d495","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baby636/lightning/commits/0b1f8fdbf0633e557946c90ae7a094126075d495","html_url":"https://github.com/baby636/lightning/commit/0b1f8fdbf0633e557946c90ae7a094126075d495","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baby636/lightning/commits/0b1f8fdbf0633e557946c90ae7a094126075d495/comments","author":{"login":"joemphilips","id":10084960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDg0OTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10084960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemphilips","html_url":"https://github.com/joemphilips","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemphilips/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemphilips/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemphilips/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemphilips/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemphilips/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemphilips/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemphilips/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemphilips/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemphilips/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"cdecker","id":120117,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDExNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/120117?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdecker","html_url":"https://github.com/cdecker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdecker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdecker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdecker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdecker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdecker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdecker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdecker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdecker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdecker/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"3fec96a7b12fdf713f67c1a5925b427c0e5bd26e","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/baby636/lightning/commits/3fec96a7b12fdf713f67c1a5925b427c0e5bd26e","html_url":"https://github.com/baby636/lightning/commit/3fec96a7b12fdf713f67c1a5925b427c0e5bd26e"}]}]
