This blew up\nthe image size immensely and caused node+yarn to run in the resulting\nimage. This new Dockerfile builds hydrogen in a separate build stage and\nthen moves the target directory into an nginx based container image,\nwhich takes care of serving the target webroot.\n\nThe existing Dockerfile has been moved to Dockerfile-dev for usage as a\ndevelopment environment. The docs have been adjusted accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, this switched from a fixed alpine version of the node\nimage to the latest alpine version, and changed the container image\nreferences in the `FROM` statements to use the fully qualified\nreferences including the registry domain.","tree":{"sha":"a5a28335c05a15838a464766867f31fede4bdd73","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mcnesium/hydrogen-web/git/trees/a5a28335c05a15838a464766867f31fede4bdd73"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mcnesium/hydrogen-web/git/commits/bc2e7a7366bd24edc686ec5da567b1e5f4ca5b6c","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mcnesium/hydrogen-web/commits/bc2e7a7366bd24edc686ec5da567b1e5f4ca5b6c","html_url":"https://github.com/mcnesium/hydrogen-web/commit/bc2e7a7366bd24edc686ec5da567b1e5f4ca5b6c","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mcnesium/hydrogen-web/commits/bc2e7a7366bd24edc686ec5da567b1e5f4ca5b6c/comments","author":{"login":"jcgruenhage","id":6861958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NjE5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6861958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcgruenhage","html_url":"https://github.com/jcgruenhage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcgruenhage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcgruenhage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcgruenhage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcgruenhage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcgruenhage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcgruenhage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcgruenhage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcgruenhage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcgruenhage/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"jcgruenhage","id":6861958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NjE5NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6861958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcgruenhage","html_url":"https://github.com/jcgruenhage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcgruenhage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcgruenhage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcgruenhage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcgruenhage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcgruenhage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcgruenhage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcgruenhage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcgruenhage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcgruenhage/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"ebca3935c507bc13e3342ec6d80816968c7d5381","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mcnesium/hydrogen-web/commits/ebca3935c507bc13e3342ec6d80816968c7d5381","html_url":"https://github.com/mcnesium/hydrogen-web/commit/ebca3935c507bc13e3342ec6d80816968c7d5381"}]}]
