Previously, the freshmaker-* console scripts\nwere installed under /usr/bin, but now they're under /usr/local/bin.\nThis is also true for the python package. It has moved from\n/usr/lib/python3.7/site-packages/freshmaker to\n/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/freshmaker\n\nThis change in path is expected as /usr/local is meant for content not\nprovided by the Linux distribution itself.\n\nAlso, man pages for the freshmaker-* console scripts are no longer\ngenerated. There appears to be no value in generating those.\n\nSigned-off-by: Luiz Carvalho <lucarval@redhat.com>\n\nwip: will this work?!\n\nSigned-off-by: Luiz Carvalho <lucarval@redhat.com>","tree":{"sha":"a660d74959df1df74776b8e300024ff6b3927792","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gnaponie/freshmaker/git/trees/a660d74959df1df74776b8e300024ff6b3927792"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gnaponie/freshmaker/git/commits/ac21de29896d481ae377061d0f417d6bc897b8a6","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gnaponie/freshmaker/commits/ac21de29896d481ae377061d0f417d6bc897b8a6","html_url":"https://github.com/gnaponie/freshmaker/commit/ac21de29896d481ae377061d0f417d6bc897b8a6","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gnaponie/freshmaker/commits/ac21de29896d481ae377061d0f417d6bc897b8a6/comments","author":{"login":"lcarva","id":5272931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNzI5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5272931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcarva","html_url":"https://github.com/lcarva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcarva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcarva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcarva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcarva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcarva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcarva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcarva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcarva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcarva/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"lcarva","id":5272931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNzI5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5272931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcarva","html_url":"https://github.com/lcarva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcarva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcarva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcarva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcarva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcarva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcarva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcarva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcarva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lcarva/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"27f05608729763b82a96b98af1b0b75a406c51e6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gnaponie/freshmaker/commits/27f05608729763b82a96b98af1b0b75a406c51e6","html_url":"https://github.com/gnaponie/freshmaker/commit/27f05608729763b82a96b98af1b0b75a406c51e6"}]}]
